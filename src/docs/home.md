# Packetframe Documentation

## Getting Started

Packetframe's API exposes all functionality of the Packetframe platform under a single HTTP API.

[DNSControl](https://github.com/StackExchange/dnscontrol/) supports the [Packetframe Provider](https://stackexchange.github.io/dnscontrol/providers/packetframe) to declaratively manage DNS records. 

## More information

See the Packetframe main site (https://packetframe.com) for more information.
